Welcome to my repo 
---

I have updated this repo to reflect my use of [Ansible's roles as of v1.2.](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks.html#roles) See [Best Practices](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_best_practices.html)
If you are looking for the old version goto the "<1.2" branch.

While PR's and suggestions are welcome, I suggest that you use [Ansible's mailing list - a google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project) or checkout their #ansible IRC on Freenode.

You will likely get faster response and more in depth answers to questions than you will find here.
