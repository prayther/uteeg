SIM (Standardized Installation & Management)

version 2.0.v.
	-first release in 2.x revision.  major update
	-utilizing latest version of puppet client, syncing from puppet labs public repo nightly (like rhn)
	-latest usgcb content, then reworked substantially:
		removed a considerable portion, not directly addressing stig
		reworked a number of modules to better reflect puppet best practices
		added a number of missing modules to better/address stig
	-split out a number of modules, from what used to be the spawar/spawar1 modules
	-implementing puppet external node classifier, this separates data from puppet code
	-adding roles, that allow down to individual host configuration
	-adding a revamped nagios/nrpe with pnp4nagios, for a complete monitoring/trending solution
	-refactoring network and network resources, such that a newly provisioned server will derive all settings from the environment
version 1.1.6 2012-08-22 14:46:57Z (defaults-.0.200-1.noarch.rpm)
	-changing back to default, removing compression in logrotate.  appears to cause a cascading log file naming issue.
	-disabled the current nrpe client config as Darryl develops nagios solution
	-cleanup of hosts.master file, removing all references to C2E
	-updated POC's in hosts.master file
	-added OS ABAC to hosts.master / wordpress.sh
	-all /var/log/*, once a week, or daily if over 5mb, keep five and compress
	-added and removed local linux accounts, based on Marco's input
	-deployed a new sosreport.sh, that is used by wordpress.sh to publish the CM page on SIM Portal
	-cleaned up the fixme.sh script, that was deployed to zero disc space for thin provisioning, when we were running out of disc space
	-deployed a root-grub-passwd.sh script that sets the root and grub passwd monthly
version 1.1.2
	-changed puppet content to run daily, change from hourly
	-adding/removing local user accts
	-updated sosreport.sh to send a copy to rhn.chs.spawar.navy.mil
	-enabled ping
	-this version has been setup for "retrofit" of boxes that have not
	 run defaults.rpm before.  to not affect current services, before we 
	 have a "role" based rpm to address individual server/services needs,
	 the modification or enabling of /etc/hosts, iptables and selinux
	 have been disabled.  Based on testing and rolling out to select machines
	 (dir-04 and db-04) we can succesfully role this package without affecting current services.	
version 1.1.1
	fixed "yum update" from running nightly
	added complimentary key in ssh
	combined puppet modules to address iptables issue
version 1.1
	is a major puppet content change from tresys CLIP to USGCB rhel5 desktop (so it works well on server but you will see some desktop specific items, like X)
