        ## (GEN000920: CAT II) (Previously - G023) The SA will ensure the root account

        ## permissions of the 창/창 directory to anything other than 0755.

        ##  this is a finding.  Home directories with permissions greater than 750 must
        ##  be justified and documented with the IAO.
