	-nrpe.conf:debug=1, allowed_hosts=127.0.0.1,150.125.75.214,198.253.24.186, dont_blame_nrpe=0

	-find /var/log/ -type f -empty -exec rm {} \;
	-modify a "default" logrotate.conf, changing only, weekly to daily
	-move root-grub-passwd.sh to daily... if a passwd is changed for convenience, it does not "fix" itself for up to a month
version 1.1.8
	-this version is back porting current development on the defaults 2.0 to provided nagios/nrpe checks
version 1.1.7 2012-10-16 12:35:15Z (defaults-.0.220-1)
	-this version was just for managing local accts.
version 1.1.6 2012-08-22 14:46:57Z (defaults-.0.200-1.noarch.rpm)
	-changing back to default, removing compression in logrotate.  appears to cause a cascading log file naming issue.

	-cleanup of hosts.master file, removing all references to C2E
	-updated POC's in hosts.master file
	-added OS ABAC to hosts.master / wordpress.sh
	-all /var/log/*, once a week, or daily if over 5mb, keep five and compress
	-added and removed local linux accounts, based on Marco's input
	-deployed a new sosreport.sh, that is used by wordpress.sh to publish the CM page on SIM Portal
	-cleaned up the fixme.sh script, that was deployed to zero disc space for thin provisioning, when we were running out of disc space
	-deployed a root-grub-passwd.sh script that sets the root and grub passwd monthly
version 1.1.2
	-changed puppet content to run daily, change from hourly
	-adding/removing local user accts
	-updated sosreport.sh to send a copy to rhn.chs.spawar.navy.mil
	-enabled ping
	-this version has been setup for "retrofit" of boxes that have not
	 run defaults.rpm before.  to not affect current services, before we 
	 have a "role" based rpm to address individual server/services needs,
	 the modification or enabling of /etc/hosts, iptables and selinux
	 have been disabled.  Based on testing and rolling out to select machines
	 (dir-04 and db-04) we can succesfully role this package without affecting current services.	
version 1.1.1
	fixed "yum update" from running nightly
	added complimentary key in ssh
	combined puppet modules to address iptables issue
version 1.1
	is a major puppet content change from tresys CLIP to USGCB rhel5 desktop (so it works well on server but you will see some desktop specific items, like X)
