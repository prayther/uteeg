      Trunk would be the main body of development, originating from
	  the the start of the project until the present.
    *

      Branch will be a copy of code derived from a certain point in
	  the trunk that is used for applying major changes to the code
	  while preserving the integrity of the code in the trunk. If the
	  major changes work according to plan, they are usually merged
	  back into the trunk.
    *

      Tag will be a point in time on the trunk or a branch that you
	  wish to preserve. The two main reasons for preservation would
	  be that either this is a major release of the software, whether
	  alpha, beta, RC or RTM, or this is the most stable point of the
	  software before major revisions on the trunk were applied.

In open source projects, major branches that are not accepted into
 the trunk by the project stakeholders can become the bases for forks
 -- e.g., totally separate projects that share a common origin with
 other source code.
